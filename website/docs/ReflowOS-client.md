[WeLoop client](https://github.com/reflow-project/weloop) is front-end software for the Reflow project, which connects to the [API](./api_tour) of [ReflowOS server](./ReflowOS-server).

It is based on web technologies so you can use it with any modern browser (desktop or mobile). The client is written in React (TypeScript and JavaScript).

The WeLoop client, the mobile app and any other frontend to ReflowOS is a **work in progress**.
