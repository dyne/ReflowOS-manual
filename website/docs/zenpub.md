<section class="reflow__doc">
  
[ReflowOS server](https://github.com/dyne/reflow-os) is the back-end software for the Reflow project.

It is based on [Bonfire](http://bonfire.cafe), a [federated](./federation) free software app ecosystem.

## Stack

The server implementation language is Elixir (running on Erlang/OTP), a language designed for building reliable systems. It uses the Phoenix web framework and the Absinthe GraphQL Toolkit to deliver a <a href="https://graphql.org/" rel="nofollow">GraphQL API</a> which the frontend interacts with. It uses ActivityPub to deliver server-to-server [federation](/docs/federation).
